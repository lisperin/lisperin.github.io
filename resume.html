      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        With over a decade of experience – ranging from individual contributor
        to managing a large technology team – I bring a diverse set of skills to
        the table. I can help bootstrap new projects, grow and mentor a team of
        developers, or manage large projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have managed mobile app development teams (iOS, Android) and server
        side teams. I also have extensive experience in various technology
        platforms including Cocoa Touch (Objective-C), C, Python/Django, Java,
        Common Lisp and Javascript.

          North is an early stage startup designed to help teams focus on

          I was with Directi for 8½ years; during this time I worked on a
          variety of projects and in various roles.
        </p>
        <ul class="work-items">
          <li>
            <strong>talk.to</strong> was a messaging app for desktop and
            mobile. I started and led development of the iOS client from the
            beginning. Besides development of the app, I also had to figure out
            and define processes for onboarding new developers onto iOS
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ringo</strong> is a low cost calling app. I led development
            of VoIP functionality in the Ringo iOS app and also overall
            development of VoIP functionality using pjsip in both the iOS and
            Android apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flock</strong> is a communication suite for teams. I led
            development of the iOS app and the Flock app store, designed the
            Flock API and the developer portal, conceptualized and managed
            product development for Github integration among other things.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After moving on from day-to-day development of the Flock iOS app, I
              managed all the client-side development teams (iOS, Android,
              Desktop). Later on I led all engineering as the CTO of Flock.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Played a significant role in growing the technology team in
            Directi's Gurgaon office from less than 10 to more than 50 people.
          </li>
          <li>
            An important responsibility I had was to mentor and train the
            technology teams I was managing. Besides ensuring sufficient
            training for my colleagues on the technologies they were directly
            working with (Objective-C, pjsip, etc.), a few other things I worked
            on include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Trained a team of manual QA engineers (and novice programmers)
                to program productively in JavaScript and graduate to automation
                QA and subsequently find work as full time software developers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Worked extensively with developers struggling with code quality
                or design issues to help them improve in these areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conducted training on general topics that developers are not
                usually familiar with, like writing a UNIX shell in C, deep dive
                into TCP/IP networking or exploring the fundamentals behind TLS.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed a TCP based proprietary alternative to TLS meant to reduce
            the number of round-trips required for handshake. At that time,
            alternatives like QUIC were not mature enough for production use.
