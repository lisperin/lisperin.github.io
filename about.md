Hi, my name is Chaitanya Gupta and I make software for a living.

These days I am building [deftask][] which aims to make task management painless
for teams.

A side project of mine is [PM Tracker][] which shows at a glance where the
Indian Prime Minister has travelled recently.

In the past, I have worked at 

* [Directi][] (2009-17) -- several products including [Flock][] and [Ringo][].
* [Cleartrip][] (2006-08) -- worked on the flight search engine.

For more details, or if you want to hire me (remote), you can read my [CV][].

(Lisp has been my programming language of choice for a long time, which is why
this site is hosted on [lisper.in][].)
