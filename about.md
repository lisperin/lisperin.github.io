Hi, my name is Chaitanya Gupta and I make software for a living.

These days I am building [deftask][] which aims to make task management painless
for teams.

A side project of mine is [PM Tracker][] which shows at a glance where the
Indian Prime Minister has travelled recently.

In the past, I have worked at 

* [Directi][] (2009-17) -- was involved with several products including [Flock][] and [Ringo][].
* [Cleartrip][] (2006-08) -- worked on the flight search engine.

Luckily, I've been able to work on some fairly interesting stuff during the
course of my career like building a VoIP app from the ground-up (using pjsip), a
low latency replacement for TLS (this was when QUIC was still in its infancy), a
certificate authority (though it got shelved before it saw light of the day).

I've also been able to work on a variety of programming languages including
Common Lisp, Javascript, C, Objective-C and Java.

Lisp has been my programming language of choice for a long time, which is why
this site is hosted on [lisper.in][].
