Hi, my name is Chaitanya Gupta and I make software for a living.

These days I am building [deftask][], which aims to make task management
painless for teams, and also work as a consultant for software teams.

In the past, I have worked at

* [Directi][] (2009-17) -- several products including [Flock][] and [Ringo][].
* [Cleartrip][] (2006-08) -- worked on the flight search engine.

(Lisp has been my programming language of choice for a long time, which is why
this site is hosted on [lisper.in][].)
