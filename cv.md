## Summary

I am a software developer with over 12 years of work experience -- ranging from
a junior developer to managing a large team of developers. I have worked on
various technology platforms including Common Lisp, Javascript (both frontend
and node.js), Objective-C (iOS development), C and Java. In addition, I have
spent a significant amount of my time hiring and scaling up technology teams
from the ground up.
