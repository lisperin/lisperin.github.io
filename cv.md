## Summary

I am a software developer with more than 12 years of work experience. My
experience ranges from working as a junior developer to managing a large team
of developers. I have worked on various technology platforms and programming
languages, including Common Lisp, Javascript (both frontend and node.js),
Objective-C (iOS development), C and Java. In addition, I have spent a
significant amount of my time hiring and scaling up technology teams from the
ground up.
