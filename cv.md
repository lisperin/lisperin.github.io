## Summary

With over 12 years of experience -- ranging from junior developer to managing a
large technology team -- I bring a diverse set of skills to the table. I can
help bootstrap new projects, grow and mentor a team of developers, or help in
managing large projects.

I have worked on various technology platforms including Common Lisp, Javascript
(both frontend and node.js), Objective-C (iOS), C and Java. In
addition, I have spent a significant amount of my time hiring for and scaling up
technology teams.

## Work History
